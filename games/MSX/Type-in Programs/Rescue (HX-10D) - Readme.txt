Game Instructions –

The Amazon Wednesday special expedition team, led by Captain Kawaguchi, has gone out on a crocodile-hunting expedition down the waters of the Amazon. Unfortunately for them, the Amazon river became flooded, causing many members of the team to get knocked unconsicous into the water.
You are tasked with saving the crew, despite your tiny boat being only able to accomodate yourself.
Given these circumstances, your best chances at success lie in helping the drowning people stay afloat, while dodging the rain of poisonous snaked falling down from above.

Use the cursor keys to move left and right, and press the Space key to aid a drowning person.
As you keep helping someone, their colour changes as their strength is restored, but focusing on only one makes all the others become weaker. If one of them drowns and dies, or if you get bitten by the snakes 3 times, it's GAME OVER.
Running over a snake with the side of your boat crushes and kills them. Your health is represented by your own colour, which changes as you get bitten.
