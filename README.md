# The MiSTer Database For Type-in Programs 

This is a database for the MiSTer project that downloads type-in programs that are being typed up and preserved by Gaming Alexandria.  Information on the project and software included in the database can be found here:

https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/type-in-programs/


To use it simply copy and paste the below to the bottom of your downloader.ini file (found at: /media/fat/downloader.ini )

```ini

db_url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgowans/typeins/db/db.json.zip
```

If anyone knows of any other preservation projects of type-in software, like Gaming Alexandria's, that could be integrated into the database then please let me know.
